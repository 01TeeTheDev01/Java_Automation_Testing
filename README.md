# Topic 1: Pipeline in GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a powerful tool provided by GitHub that allows you to automate workflows for your GitHub repositories. It enables you to build, test, and deploy your code right from your repository.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Workflow**: A workflow is a configurable-automated process made up of one or more jobs. Workflows are defined in YAML files stored in your repository under the `.github/workflows` directory.

2. **Jobs**: A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel, depending on how you define them.

3. **Steps**: Steps are individual tasks that execute commands. They are the building blocks of a job and can perform actions like checking out code, running scripts, or deploying code.

4. **Actions**: Actions are reusable units of code that can be used across different workflows. They are defined in YAML files and can be included in your workflow to perform specific tasks.

### Typical Use Cases:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically build and test your code whenever you push new changes.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploy your application to servers or cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud when tests pass.

- **Scheduled Tasks**: Perform periodic tasks such as generating reports or backups.

- **Issue Labeling and Management**: Automate issue labeling based on certain triggers or conditions.

### Example Workflow File:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2  # Check out the repository
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
    - name: Install dependencies

2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Supports multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, allowing you to test your web applications across different environments.

3. **WebDriver API**: Selenium WebDriver is the primary interface for writing tests in Java. It provides methods to interact with web elements, manage windows and alerts, and execute JavaScript.

4. **Synchronization**: Provides mechanisms (like implicit waits, explicit waits, and fluent waits) to handle synchronization issues that may arise during test execution.

5. **Testing Framework Integration**: Integrates well with testing frameworks such as JUnit and TestNG, making it easy to manage and execute tests as part of your continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

6. **Headless Browser Support**: Supports headless browser testing, which allows tests to run without a visible browser UI, ideal for CI/CD environments.

### Example Usage:

Here’s a basic example of using Selenium WebDriver with Java to automate a simple test scenario:

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.*;

public class SeleniumTest {

    private WebDriver driver;

    @BeforeClass
    public void setup() {
        // Set path to the chromedriver executable (you need to download chromedriver.exe and provide the path)
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/path/to/chromedriver");

        // Initialize ChromeDriver instance
        driver = new ChromeDriver();
    }

    @Test
    public void testGoogleSearch() {
        // Open Google
        driver.get("https://www.google.com");

        // Find the search box element
        WebElement searchBox = driver.findElement(By.name("q"));

        // Type something to search for
        searchBox.sendKeys("Selenium WebDriver");

        // Submit the search query
        searchBox.submit();

        // Verify search results page title
        Assert.assertTrue(driver.getTitle().startsWith("Selenium WebDriver"), "Page title doesn't start with 'Selenium WebDriver'");
    }

    @AfterClass
    public void teardown() {
        // Close the browser
        if (driver != null) {
            driver.quit();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **WebDriver setup**: Before executing tests, set up the WebDriver instance (in this case, ChromeDriver).

- **@BeforeClass**: Method annotated with `@BeforeClass` runs once before any of the test methods in the class.

- **driver.get()**: Navigate to a URL (`https://www.google.com` in this example).

- **driver.findElement()**: Find an element on the web page (the search box).

- **WebElement.sendKeys()**: Type text into an input field (search for "Selenium WebDriver").

- **searchBox.submit()**: Submit the form (perform the search).

- **Assert.assertTrue()**: Verify if the page title starts with "Selenium WebDriver".

- **@AfterClass**: Method annotated with `@AfterClass` runs once after all the test methods in the class have been run.

### Setting Up Selenium WebDriver with Java:

To use Selenium WebDriver with Java, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. **Download WebDriver**: Download the WebDriver executable (e.g., chromedriver for Chrome, geckodriver for Firefox) and provide its path in your test setup.

2. **Set System Property**: Set the system property `webdriver.chrome.driver` (or `webdriver.gecko.driver` for Firefox) with the path to the WebDriver executable.

3. **Add Dependencies**: Include Selenium WebDriver dependency in your project's build file (Maven or Gradle):

#
# Topic 4: Cucumber
Cucumber is a popular open-source tool for behavior-driven development (BDD), which allows you to write tests in a natural language style that can be easily understood by non-technical stakeholders. Cucumber with Java is widely used for automating acceptance tests written in Gherkin, a plain-text language that uses keywords like `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, and `But`.

### Key Concepts of Cucumber with Java:

1. **Feature Files**: Feature files are written in Gherkin syntax and describe the behavior of the application in a human-readable format. They typically have scenarios with steps that map to automation code.

2. **Step Definitions**: Step definitions are Java methods that match the steps defined in the feature files. They execute the actions and validations needed to automate the scenario.

3. **Glue Code**: Glue code is the Java code that connects the steps in the feature file to the automation code. Cucumber uses annotations and regular expressions to map steps to Java methods.

4. **Hooks**: Hooks allow you to define setup and teardown operations before and after scenarios. They are annotated methods that run at various points during the execution of Cucumber scenarios.

5. **Tags**: Tags in Cucumber allow you to organize and filter scenarios. They are used to mark scenarios or features and can be used to run specific sets of scenarios.

### Example Usage:

Here’s an example to illustrate how Cucumber works with Java:

#### 1. Feature File (`src/test/resources/features/search.feature`):

```gherkin
Feature: Searching on a website
  As a user
  I want to search for products
  So that I can find what I'm looking for

  Scenario: Searching for a product
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I search for "laptop"
    Then I should see search results for "laptop"
```

#### 2. Step Definitions (`src/test/java/stepDefinitions/SearchSteps.java`):

```java
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class SearchSteps {

    private WebDriver driver;

    @Given("I am on the homepage")
    public void i_am_on_the_homepage() {
        // Set path to the chromedriver executable (you need to download chromedriver.exe and provide the path)
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/path/to/chromedriver");

        // Initialize ChromeDriver instance
        driver = new ChromeDriver();

        // Open the homepage
        driver.get("https://www.example.com");
    }

    @When("I search for {string}")
    public void i_search_for(String searchTerm) {
        // Find the search input field and enter the search term
        driver.findElement(By.name("q")).sendKeys(searchTerm);

        // Submit the search
        driver.findElement(By.name("q")).submit();
    }

    @Then("I should see search results for {string}")
    public void i_should_see_search_results(String expectedSearchTerm) {
        // Verify the search results page title or content
        String pageTitle = driver.getTitle();
        // Perform assertions to validate search results
        // Example: Assert.assertTrue(pageTitle.contains(expectedSearchTerm));
    }

    // Cleanup after scenario execution
    @After
    public void tearDown() {
        // Close the browser
        if (driver != null) {
            driver.quit();
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Test Runner (`src/test/java/TestRunner.java`):

```java
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    features = "src/test/resources/features",
    glue = {"stepDefinitions"},
    tags = "@Search", // Run scenarios tagged with @Search
    plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber-reports"}
)
public class TestRunner {
    // This class will run the Cucumber tests
}
```

# Topic 8: TestNG
TestNG (Test Next Generation) is a widely used testing framework for Java that facilitates various testing needs, from unit testing to integration testing. It provides functionalities that enhance the capabilities of JUnit and enables developers to write powerful and flexible tests. Here's an overview of TestNG in Java:

### Key Features of TestNG:

1. **Annotations**: TestNG uses annotations to mark methods as test methods (`@Test`), setup and teardown methods (`@BeforeMethod`, `@AfterMethod`, etc.), and suite-level setup and teardown methods (`@BeforeSuite`, `@AfterSuite`). This allows for easy configuration and execution of tests.

2. **Parameterization**: TestNG supports parameterized tests using the `@Parameters` annotation or data providers (`@DataProvider`). This enables running the same test with different sets of data.

3. **Dependency Management**: TestNG allows defining dependencies between test methods using the `dependsOnMethods` attribute, ensuring tests run in a specific order based on dependencies.

4. **Groups**: Tests can be grouped logically using the `@Test(groups = "group-name")` annotation. This feature allows running specific groups of tests selectively, based on requirements.

5. **Assertions**: TestNG provides built-in assertion methods (`Assert.assertEquals`, `Assert.assertTrue`, etc.) for verifying expected outcomes in test cases.

6. **Listeners**: TestNG supports listeners (`IInvokedMethodListener`, `ISuiteListener`, etc.) that enable customizing test execution behavior and capturing events during test runs.

7. **Reporting**: It generates detailed HTML reports that include information about test execution results, including pass/fail status, test durations, and exceptions.

### Setting Up TestNG in Java:

To use TestNG in your Java project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Add TestNG Dependency:

Include TestNG dependency in your project's build file (Maven or Gradle):

**For Maven**:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
    <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
    <version>7.4.0</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

**For Gradle**:

```groovy
testImplementation 'org.testng:testng:7.4.0' // Replace with the latest version
```

#### 2. Writing Test Cases:

Create test classes and annotate methods according to TestNG conventions:

```java
import org.testng.annotations.Test;
import org.testng.Assert;

public class TestNGExample {

    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        int result = a + b;
        Assert.assertEquals(result, 30);
    }

    @Test(dependsOnMethods = "testAddition")
    public void testSubtraction() {
        int a = 20;
        int b = 10;
        int result = a - b;
        Assert.assertTrue(result > 0);
    }
}
```

#### 3. Running Tests:

Execute TestNG tests using IDE integrations (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or build tools (Maven, Gradle):

- **Using Maven**:
  ```bash
  mvn clean test
  ```

- **Using Gradle**:
  ```bash
  gradle clean test
  ```

#### 4. Generating Reports:

After running tests, TestNG generates HTML reports in the `test-output` directory by default. Open the HTML file (`emailable-report.html` or `index.html`) in a browser to view the test execution results.

### Benefits of TestNG:

- **Flexible and Powerful**: Offers extensive features for test configuration, dependency management, and parameterization, enhancing test flexibility and power.

- **Integration**: Integrates smoothly with build tools like Maven and Gradle, as well as continuous integration tools like Jenkins, facilitating automated test execution.
